                        Since 2008 Embrace Rwanda International Society a Vancouver-based Christian charity 
                        has helped to bring powerful, meaningful and sustainable change to Rwanda’s rural communities. 
                        For a region hit hard by poverty, genocide and disease, the transformation is remarkable.  
                        It is estimated that at least 24,000 have now benefited from the work of Embrace Rwanda.

                        Embrace Rwanda is a grassroots community development partnership between Canada and Rwanda. 
                        Under the leadership of North Vancouver’s Hilary King, the initial focus was to provide 
                        continuing support for poverty-stricken rural families through an initiative called the 
                        “Healthy Mums Program”. Years later, the initiative stands on four pillars of community 
                        development and support: maternal/child health, early childhood education, building capacity 
                        through a Vocational Training Center and a social/ economic development/ savings and credit 
                        program to support the development of small business. In Canada, the charity is run entirely 
                        by volunteers, many of whom visit Rwanda annually to offer skills and support. 
                        This volunteer component enables 100% of all funds raised here to go directly to Rwanda.

                        Embrace Rwanda provides a remarkable example of how developing relationships, establishing 
                        partnerships and building on the strengths and resilience of a very vulnerable population 
                        has created an environment for healing and growth. Our evaluations of the Healthy Mums Program 
                        show a significant difference in health outcomes. With this proven success, other regions and countries
                        in Africa are interested in adopting the Embrace Rwanda model.
                        Foundational to the success and sustainability of these initiatives is the 
                        collaboration between and among many sectors of government and non-governmental agencies in Rwanda, Canada, 
                        the United Kingdom and the USA to provide education, support and funding.

                        Embrace Rwanda embodies mutual respect and understanding. 
                        The Rwandan journey out of the darkness of genocide cannot be ignored. 
                        As one Embrace Rwanda participant noted, “You have brought out our sorrows. 
                        It is very important.” The project’s Rwandan partners and participants are 
                        determined to move forward with hope, in the spirit of reconciliation. 
                        This creates sustainability and self-sufficiency, 
                        the two primary goals of local Rwandans. Through the power of many partnerships, 
                        Embrace Rwanda is working and growing, creating a bridge between poverty and 
                        hope for a healthy future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The day-to-day running of the programs is managed by the local Bishop 
                        and the local Embrace Rwanda staff.  Teams from North America visit the 
                        projects on a regular basis each year to provide advice and training. 
                        The programs are ecumenical and accessible by all people who live in the 
                        local area.

                        The goals of Embrace Rwanda are in line with the Rwanda government’s “Vision 20/20” 
                        Millennium goals and so the model of Embrace Rwanda which started in Kigeme Diocese 
                        is now being replicated in other Dioceses, Butare, Cyangugu, Byumba, Gasabo and Shyogwe.
